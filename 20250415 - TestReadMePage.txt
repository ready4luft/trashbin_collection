It is time to learn something!

I've added a README.MD file, but it seems it was not necessary for that.
So, we need to add some info about us (mail and name), and publish branch after.

PS C:\Users\Дмитрий> git config --global user.email "ready4luft@gmail.com"
PS C:\Users\Дмитрий> git config --global user.name "Demetrius"

It works pretty well with no requirments of UTF decoding.
